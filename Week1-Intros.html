            <section data-markdown>
              ### Be **Present**

              Listen, soak up the information (there's a lot of it), process it.
            </section>
            <section data-markdown>
              ### Ask **Questions**

              I'm not big on formality. Feel free to ask any question that comes to mind. I'll also stop frequently for questions.

            <section data-markdown>
              ### **Support** each other

              I'm a big proponent of pair programming. Any in-class exercise or project work may be paired and certain labs _will_ be paired or in groups. Larger final projects will be group projects.
            </section>
            <section data-markdown>
              ### Have **fun**

              See previous comment on my stance on formality and ceremony. Bored people learn nothing. I'll do what I can to make this fun as well as instructive.

        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ### Keys to success

          As of right now, your primary job description is:
          ### figure it out
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ### Keys to success

          Developers are essentially well-paid problem solvers. If you come across something you're not sure about you need to make an effort to solve the issue yourself.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ### Keys to success

          some 'rules' for when you get stuck:

          1. First, ask google
          1. Second, ask a fellow bootcamper
          1. Third, ask another fellow bootcamper
          1. If you're still stumped ask me
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ### Keys to success

          The rule about 'the rules'

          That said, don't be a hero and spin your wheels for hours without progress. It profits no one. If you're genuinely stuck, ask for help and keep asking until you get it.

          ### keys to success

          _Most importantly_

          ###PRACTICE!!

          We won't have a lot of 'homework' for this class but any extra time you spend workin on this stuff will only deepen your understanding of the material. If you finish an assignment early, look for ways to go a step further or do some extra work on the Final Project.

          ## Getting Started

          **Note** that some of this should already be done. This is mostly a checklist of things we will need for smooth(ish) sailing in this course.

        <section data-markdown>
          ### Install Google Chrome

          (If you don't already have it)

          Technically any modern browser will work but we will using some extensions that are specific to Chrome for this course. So make sure you have Chrome on your machine.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ### Install a text editor

          A couple of recommendations:
          - Sublime Text*
          - Atom.io
          - Whatever else you're comfortable with

          \*  I'm most comfortable with Sublime and I will be of the most help to you if you use it. Anything else and you're on your own.

          ### Slack Channel

          You've probably already been invited to the Slack channel.
          http://www.grand-circus.slack.com

          If you haven't, let me know at the next break and we will get you added.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ### Private Group

          `javascript`

          We have a private group within the Slack channel specifically for this bootcamp. It will be a place for communication and collaboration between classes and over the weekend. It will also be where I post slides and other extra materials.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ### github

          [github.com](http://github.com)

          Make yourself a GitHub profile.

          It will be a little while before we need it, but go ahead and take care of this now while we're setting up everything.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ### git

          To download git, visit

          [git's website](http://www.git-scm.com/download),

          choose your platform and install git.

          Like GitHub, it'll be a little while before we need this, but better to get all of this stuff out of the way at once.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ### Trello

          [Trello.com](http://trello.com)

          Make yourself a Trello profile.

          Trello is a web-based organizational tool. It can be used for lots of different things but we will be using it as our card wall for the final project for this class.

          Once you have your Trello and GitHub user names, post them in the Slack channel.

        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ### Terminology

          Some key terms or phrases that are used as a matter of course in the software industry. You may know some or all of these, or you may have heard the terms but be unclear about their actual meaning. They are common jargon among developers
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ### Web Development

          Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet. In industry parlance, 'web development' usually refers to the more code-related tasks such as programming JavaScript, coding HTML and CSS. It can even extend to tasks related to the back end server infrastructure such as creating web services and handling business logic for a company or product.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ### Web Design

          The process of planning & structuring a website; specifically, the visual aspects and assets for the site. Recently, this job description has also begun to include interaction design. That is, designing the user experience (UX), information architecture, and the flow of the application or site.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ### web site

          A largely informational web page. While they may include dynamic elements and react to user inputs. The general purpose of a web site is to provide information about a person, business, product, or service.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ### web application

          A more recent term to indicate a web site whose sole purpose is not just informational, but rather functional. Web applications have become robust enough to do everything from our taxes, manage our personal calendars, or even do standard desktop publishing tasks.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ### Front End

          The visible and interactive parts of a website or application.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ### Back End

          The 'invisible' or inner functionality of a website or application. Examples include costly calculations, interacting with a database or making use of web service end points. While we're at it...
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ### Web Service

          A software function provided at a network address over the Web. The W3C defines a Web service generally as:

          >"A software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network."
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ### Database

          A software system for storing data long term. This is also sometimes referred to as a 'persistance layer'.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ### Version control

          A software tool for managing changes to a set of files, website, application or any collection of files and for reconciling the differences between those files when conflicts emerge.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ### Application Programming Interface (API)

          An API is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. An API expresses a software component in terms of its operations, inputs, outputs, and underlying types. An API defines functionalities that are independent of their respective implementations, _which allows definitions and implementations to vary without compromising each other._

          opening tag

          `< p >`

          closing tag

          `< /p >`
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ### Example

          `<p>This is a paragraph</p>`

          A paragraph elment consists of an opening `&lt;p&gt;` tag and a closing `&lt;/p&gt;` tag and the content between the tags.

          ## Different kinds of elements

          Elements can be either container elements (they hold content) or stand-alone elements, sometimes called self-closing elements.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ### Different kinds of elements

          Paragraph elements are containers

          `&lt;p&gt;Hi, I contain content&lt;/p&gt;`

          Image elements are stand-alone

          `&lt;img  src="james.jpg" /&gt;`
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ### Attributes

          1. Provide additional information about HTML elements
          1. Attribute tags include class, id, style, language, and source
          1. Attributes are positioned inside the opening tag, before the right bracket
          1. Attributes are paired with values. Key / value pairs are an important concept in programming.
          1. Selected from a pre-defined set of possible attributes depending on the element.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ### Values

          1. Values are assigned to attributes
          1. Values must be contained inside quotation marks

          `&lt;ul&gt;` is for unordered lists.

          `&lt;ol&gt;` is for ordered (numbered) lists.

          This tag will change how the the list items are rendered.

              <section data-markdown>
              ### Anchor element

              Links to other sites on the web (or within your project) are created using this element.

              `&lt;a href="http://facebook.com"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;`

              Note: I do not call this a 'Link' tag even though we refer to these hyperlinks as such. There is already a link tag...

              <section data-markdown>
                  ### Link element

                  Unlike the anchor element. The `&lt;link&gt;` specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource.

                  Most often this manifests as how CSS files are included with an HTML file.

                  `&lt;link src="main.css" rel='stylesheet' /&gt;`

          ### Table element

          Tables are a way to represent complex information in a grid format. They are made of rows and columns.

          Tables are compound elements (similar to lists) they are made up of several elements.

          Element | Description
          --- | ---
          `&lt;table&gt;` | Table element
          `&lt;tr&gt;` | Table row
          `&lt;td&gt;` | Table cell

          In a new project folder, create another basic site using only HTML from scratch.
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Your site should contain the following elements:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Basics: Doctype, HTML, Head, & Body</li>
            <li>One or more division tags for organization</li>
            <li>At least 3 headings of different size</li>
            <li>A least 5 paragraphs</li>
            <li>One of each list type (ordered and unordered)</li>
            <li>At least 3 links</li>
            <li>At least 2 images</li>
            <li>some HTML comments</li>
            <li>1 table</li>

              ###Bonus!

              Use some combination of elements such as:

              - A list of links
              - An image that serves as a hyperlink

              <section data-markdown>
                  ### CSS Rules

                  CSS rules are made up of two parts:
                  - One or more selectors
                  - One or more declarations
                  - The declaration must be inside curly braces that follows the selector

                  ### CSS Declarations
                  Declarations are made up of the property and value of the style you want to apply.

                  They can be grouped together so that more than one declaration may be applied to a selected element.

                  Declaration groups must be surrounded by curly brackets.

                  Declarations must end in a semicolon.

                  ###CSS Properties

                  There are literally hundreds of css properties that are available for use. We don't have time to go over more than just a few. We will go over a few of the most common. However, the best strategy is to google for styling options as you're working.

                **Block elements** each appear on a new line of a web page, like paragraphs. Spatially, what is happening is that the block element takes up all of the horizontal space it can. It stretches to fill all the space to the left and right of the element within its parent container.

                **Inline elements** are rendered without starting a new line. They appear side by side until reaching the edge of its parent container. Then it will start a new line.

              <section data-markdown>
                  ### The box model

                  Every HTML element is in a box, regardless of its visible shape.
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                  ### The box model

                  The total size of an element is a combination of the following:
                  - Content
                  - Padding
                  - Border
                  - Margin

              <section data-markdown>
                  ### padding

                  Padding is the space between the content within an element and the border. Padding can be specified in units of pixels (px), Ems (em), or points (pt) or percentage (%) of the containing element.
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                  ### padding

                  Padding is a CSS property (just like color or font-family) and is defined using the same rules. The only difference is that there a few different ways to write them.

                  ###Margin

                  Margins are the space outside the element that separates it from other elements. It is 'outside the fence' in terms of its relationship to the border.

                  ###Auto Margin

                  If margin is set to `auto` on an element that has a set width, it will take up as much space as possible. You can use this to center or left or right justify an element. This only works for horizontally centering.

            <section data-markdown>
                ###CSS Positioning

                Every HTML element has a property called `position` which dictates how that element flows on a document. This property can be set to a number of different values, each of which behave slightly differently. This gives a web developer greater control over the design and overall look of a page.

            <section data-markdown>
                ###static positioning

                Static positioning is the default for all HTML elements. And it adheres to the previously discussed behavior of block and inline elements. Block elements flow from top to bottom and each element appears on a new line. Inline elements flow from left to right, wrapping as needed.

                ### Absolute positioning

                Absolutely positioned are removed from the normal flow of the document. They are not affected by and do not affect other elements in the flow, regardless of their position in the document.
            </section>
            <section data-markdown>
                ### Absolute positioning

                Absolute positioned elements appear relative to their parent container elements, using the top/bottom/right/left properties for offsets.

            <section data-markdown>
                ### Absolute positioning

                You can think of absolutely positioned elements as being stuck onto a page with a magnet. Once placed, they don't move.

                Fixed positioned elements are very similar to absolutely positioned elements. Fixed positioned elements are also removed from the normal flow of the document. They are not affected by and do not affect other elements in the flow, regardless of their position in the document.
            </section>
            <section data-markdown>
                ### fixed positioning

                Fixed positioned elements appear relative to the view port (the browser window), using the top/bottom/right/left properties for offsets.
            </section>
            <section data-markdown>
                ### fixed positioning

                Fixed elements do not move when you scroll up or down the page. They seem fixed to the window.

            <section data-markdown>
                ### Float

                "Floating" takes an element in the normal flow and pushes it as far to the left or right of its parent element as possible. When an element is floated, other elements will wrap around it
            </section>
            <section data-markdown>
                ### Float

                - Always specify a width when floating an element
                - Specify whether an element should float left or right
                - If two or more elements are floated, they will 'stack up' on whichever side they are floated to.

                  ### z-index

                  When elements are moved out of the normal flow of content, they can overlap. Z-index can be used to define the order of overlapping elements. The element with the highest z-index goes on top.

                  ###HTML5

                  HTML5 is a new spec from the W3C that expands the language of HTML and adds a bunch of new features.
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                  ###HTML5

                  We don't have time to go into all the details of all of HTML5's new features. Here are some highlights:

                  - New semantic tags
                  - Multimedia (new Audio and Video tags)
                  - Offline storage (local storage)
                  - 3d graphics support
                  - CSS3 animations and effects

              `:only-child` | Any element which is the only child of its parent
              `:empty` | Any element which has no children

                  ### nth-child syntax

                  `:nth-child` takes a mathmatic express to determine which children to select.

                  `element:nth-child(an + b) { property:value; }`
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                  ### nth-child examples

                  These expressions can be as complex as you want. Feel free to mess around with it.

                  `div:nth-child(3) { color:red; }`

                  `p:nth-child(4n) { color:blue; }`

                  `ul:nth-child:(2n + 5) { color:yellow; }`
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                  ### nth-child examples

                  Realistically though, in practice `nth-child` is usually only used to alternate styles for large groups of data like table rows, etc.

                  `element:nth-child(even) { property:value; }`

                  `element:nth-child(odd) { property:value; }`

                  This is done via Media Queries. Media queries are able to detect a bunch of things about the device with which you're viewing a site. The browser can use specifically developed CSS styles for those different screen sizes.
